Dear {{dat['First author']}},

we have processed your abstract an html file and into a pdf file (using LaTeX)
so that you can check that everything looks right in both formats. Open the
html file in a webbrowser as some email programs don't render the formulas
correctly.

Note that some symbols e.g. "%" work just fine in html, but might cause
unintended effects in LaTeX; it is best to avoid these (e.g. write "0.3" or "30
percent " instead of "30 %")

If you want to change your contribution, you can simply edit it with
the link in the initial confirmation email. We will send you another
message like this after every change.  Although the link will continue
to work, the SOC many not accept changes made after the deadline.

Common reasons why your abstract might not format correctly:

- Formulas should be written like this: $0.3\; M_\odot$. They will be rendered
  both in LaTeX and html.

- Author and institution numbering: If you list more than one
  institution please add numbers like "(1)" or "(1,3)" behind the
  authorname, but do NOT number the institutions (they are numbered
  automatically).

If you need assistance or notice a problem with this message, please
contact the Moritz Guenther at hgunther@mit.edu.

Looking forward to see you at CS20!

Yours,
   Moritz
