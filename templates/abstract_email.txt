Dear {{dat['First author']}},

we have processed your abstract into a pdf and an html file so that
you can check that everything looks right. In particular, make sure
any LaTeX symbols are shown as you intend.

Note that links like "top of the page" do not work until your abstract
is added to the full list on the Cool Stars website.

If you want to change your contribution, you can simply edit it with
the link in the initial confirmation email. We will send you another
message like this after every change.  Although the link will continue
to work, the SOC many not accept changes made after the deadline.

Common reasons why your abstract might not format correctly:

- The LaTeX system cannot process astronomy specific symbols. For
  example, use $M_\odot$ instead of $M_\sun$.

- Author and institution numbering: If you list more than one
  institution please add numbers like "(1)" or "(1,3)" behind the
  authorname, but do NOT number the institutions (they are numbered
  automatically).

If you need assistance or notive a problem with this message, please
contact the Moritz Guenther, the chair of the LOC, at hgunther@mit.edu.

Looking forward to see you at CS20!

Yours,
   Moritz
