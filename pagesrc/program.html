      <h2><span>Program</span></h2>
      <div class="c12 row">
	<p>The meeting will cover the following five science themes:</p>

	<h3>Galactic Cartography in the Gaia Era</h3>
	<p>Starting with our own solar neighborhood and moving to
	greater distances using luminous stars, what have we learned
	from the current programs and what will be accomplished in the
	future? Do these surveys provide quality information needed
	for modelers and theoreticians to address many problems in
	stellar evolution, star formation, cluster formation,
	disk/halo/bulge formation and evolution?</p>
	
	<h3> Fundamental Properties of Cool Stars</h3>
	<p>From asteroseismology of stellar interiors to construction
	of stellar atmospheres, the physical parameters of cool stars
	remain fundamental quantities of astrophysics. Our
	understanding is being refined by new
	capabilities. Measurement of masses, radii, abundances,
	rotation are required for stars in the field and in
	clusters. Understanding of stellar evolution, interpretation
	of complex color­magnitude diagrams, and characteristics of
	exoplanet hosts are among the topics that benefit from
	improvement of these quantities.</p>
	
	<h3>Solar/Stellar Environments</h3>
	<p>Our Sun and stars interact with their surroundings through
	radiation and plasma. Stellar winds span almost 10 orders of
	magnitude in flux. Transient events - violent coronal mass
	ejections and flares - produce both enhanced radiation and
	particles surrounding a star. The environment can interact
	with stars as well via the process of accretion. Can we
	quantify the characteristics of these events and define how
	these processes change as a star is formed and evolves?<p>
	  
	<h3>Solar/Stellar Magnetic Fields and Surface Structure</h3>
	<p>Magnetic fields remain fundamental to the evolution of
	stars and to their atmospheric structures. A magnetic dynamo
	drives stellar cycles which in turn affects magnetic field
	configurations and the angular momentum evolution of a
	star. How do surface phenomena – such as star spots and flares
	– change with stellar mass and evolutionary stage? How can we
	prepare for the arrival of the innovative solar telescope
	DKIST, which will offer unprecedented spatial resolution of the
	surface of the Sun?</p>
	
	<h3>Very Low Mass (VLM) Objects</h3>
	<p>Low mass stars and brown dwarfs present one extreme of
	stellar physics that becomes more prominent as exoplanet
	hosts. These objects can harbor very cool and puzzling
	atmospheric structures and behavior. What do we know about
	their magnetic structures and flaring activity? What are their
	fundamental parameters such as mass, abundances, atmospheric
	structures?</p>
