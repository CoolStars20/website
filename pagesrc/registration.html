        <p>Registration will open in the next few days (we were delayed by a
        large snow storm in Boston). The registration fee will be about 475 $ for early registration.</p>
        <p>Our facilities can support about 500 attendees. Based on the previous Cool Stars meetings, we expect that every interested astronomer should have a chance to join in, but the only guarantee is to register early. Subscribe to our announcement list to be informed when registration opens.<p>

      <h2><span>Financial support</span></h2>
	 <p> Limited financial support is available to allow students and other early career astronomers to attend CS20, if their institution cannot provide sufficient funds.
