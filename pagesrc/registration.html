        <p>Registration will open about 9 months before the conference begins.</p>
        <p>Our facilities can support about 500 attendees. Based on the previous Cool Stars meetings, we expect that every interested astronomer should have a chance to join in, but the only guarantee is to register early. Subscribe to our announcement list to be informed when registration opens.<p>
