        <p>We accept submissions for plenary talks and poster contributions.</p>

	<p> Our facilities can support about 500 attendees with talks or posters. Based on the previous Cool Stars meetings, we expect that every interested astronomer should have a chance to join in, but the only guarantee is to submit your abstract early. Subscribe to our announcement list to be informed when registration opens.<p>
